# Betterment - Robo-Advisor
## Overview and Origin

* Betterment uses robo-advising and automated cash management services to bring efficiency into the financial advisory industry. They are registered with the SEC as well as a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority(FIRA). Betterment is a registered investment advisor and broker-dealer, however their strategy is very tech-oriented compared to traditional financial/investment advisory companies. While Betterment offers checking and savings accounts, traditional and Roth IRAs, as well as more recently human financial advisors, their main focus and point of differentiation is in automated goal-based investing. To achieve this, they manage portfolios of passive index-tracking equity and fixed income ETFs.

* Betterment was founded in 2008 and officially launched in June of 2010 at *TechCrunch Disrupt New York*, an annual 3-day event that includes meet-and-greets with investors, special guest lectures, and even hackathons, winning the award of "Biggest New York Disruptor." 

* Jon Stein and Eli Broverman are the founders of Betterment. Jon Stein initially began the project with his roommate, a Google software engineer, and Eli Broverman was brought in to handle the regulations associated with starting a financial company since he was a securities lawyer at the time. Interestingly enough, Jon and Eli met over regular poker games.

* The idea for Betterment came about in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. There was widespread greed in not only the mortgage industry, but also in the credit rating companies and derivitatives markets that led to a massive amount of wealth being obliterated, leaving many unable to make payments on their mortgages and losing large portions of their retirement funds. Jon Stein wanted to built a company, "to help people do what's right with their money so they can live better." Betterment claims to act as a fiduciary and that they behave with their clients best interest in mind.

* In December of 2010, Betterment raised $3M in their Series A round. There were 8 total investors, the lead investor being Bessemer Venture Partners. Series B was announced in October of 2012, raising $10M. From there, the funding amounts saw a sizeable increase as follows: Series C $32M, Series D $60M, Series E $100M, and Series E $70. This brings the total funding amount to $275M, the lastest round in August of 2017. Betterment charges a 0.25% management fee.

## Business Activities

* Betterment was built with the client's best interest in mind, in regards to those clients reaching their financial goals and doing so in a responsible manner. Greed was running rampant in financial markets and corruption and deception finally came to a head when the mortgage industry collapsed. By managing risk with clients' goals in mind, the product offered is a customer-tailered portfolio of passive index-tracking equity and fixed-income ETFs.

* Betterment was built for a wide range of customers; from older generations looking to safely maintain their wealth through retirement and golden-years to young investors who are quite busy with the opening chapters of their careers who want a one-stop-shop investment management company that automates a lot of the heavy lifting(research and trading). Each year, more money is transferred from traditional avenues into robo-advisor led investment platforms. Robo-advised assets under management are projected to hit over $1.3 trillion by the end of 2021, and over $2.8 trillion by 2025 showing an annual growth rate of over 20%. In a little over 10 short years, Betterment has accumulated over $29 billion of assets under management. The traditional competitors in the space are investment and brokerage firms. Examples of these traditional competitors include Charles Schwab and Edward Jones, as well as investment managers within retail banks and putting together your own portfolio through platforms such as E-Trade, or even newer platforms such as Robinhood. What sets Betterment apart from the others is the level of automation they have implemented into the portfolio managing process. Based on information the client provides, such as their goals and timelines, Betterment can put together an investment strategy tailered to the client without needing employees such as traditional brokers. This ultimately creates a cost-saving to the client in lower management fees, increasing the potential return for their clients.

* Betterment, from its origin, has implemented robo-advisors that take information provided by the client and can offer portfolio strategies that are specific to the client. They have implemented their technology into the financial industry through javaScript, Python, and PHP coding, delivering this content at high data transfer speeds with Amazon CloudFront, and using Google Cloud Platform's suite of cloud computing services. Betterment uses Google Analytics for interpreting information and fine-tune their offerings, and then uses Mixpanel to convert, engage, and retain more users. Their DevOps uses Docker containers to simulate multiple physical worker machines that connect to the officially maintained containers. Betterment also uses business tools such as WordPress to generate aesthetically pleasing materials to clients and Qualaroo to deploy surveys to continuously improve upon their products and services.

## Landscape:

* Betterment, like most of the FinTech companies that my classmates are covering for this first homework assignment, spills into several different domains of the financial industry. Investment management and Robo-advising are the areas of focus, but since they offer checking and savings accounts, as well as Roth IRAs, they are very much in the personal finance and online banking domains as well.

* Trends of FinTech companies in the Investment management domain have been implementing an increasing amount of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, and more recently blockchain. These tools allow new players in the space, as well as adaptive veteran companies to differentiate their offerings as well as better utilize the massive amount of data they collect to make more informed decisions. Other trends include using the Internet of Things (IoT) to pass information about products and services to their customer base as well as get real-time data about their clients' assets. Regulation is becoming increasingly complex and FinTech companies have utilized RegTech to remain compliant. Since the 2008 financial crisis, financial regulations have become much tighter, and this trend of streamlining the compliance aspect of their businesses is a natural next step in dealing with an increasing amount of "red-tape." There are many other trends that have occured in the last 10 years, but one of the most important of those trends is how FinTech companies have prioritized the privacy of the data they collect. There have been massive hacks, such as Equifax breach, leading to trends of increased data security. Cybercrime has grown into a massive problem globally and this trend will surely continue to ensure a safe-environment for FinTech customers' data.

* The number of Robo-advising investment platforms is growing very rapidly. Some of the other players in the space include SoFi,M1 Finance, Wealthfront, Vanguard, and STASH. There are slight differences in these competitors, mainly in management fees, account minimums, as well as different promotions such as $5,000 amount of assets managed for free or your first 90 days having no advisory fees. However, there are also quite a bit of similarities in their approach. All firms seek to diversify their client's portfolios based on their goals and appetite for risk. With these preferences in mind, as well as timeframes for these goals, Robo-advisor investment firms are able to diversify investments into index funds, specific companies, fixed-income ETFs, and bonds. 

## Results

* Betterment is leading the way amongst the field of Robo-Advisors. By allowing clients to have multiple portfolios, all based on goals that the client is pursuing, they can further divide their investment by implementing different strategies for portions of their investments. This level of diversification and goal-oriented investing is leaving a big impact on the financial industry by changing the way investors think about their money and how to grow it. Another impact Betterment has left on the industry is that they have no account minimums while still maintaining very low fees on investments. This is forcing other companies in the space to cut their fees in order to attract new clients or even retain the clients they currently have. Betterment also offers fractional shares so all of the money their clients invest with them is invested.

* The most obvious metric that comes to mind when comparing companies in the investment management domain is return on investment(ROI). However, this metric isn't a "tell-all" when it comes to their performance since Betterment offers goal-based portfolios. The client's appetite for risk is managed with each goal, as to not expose the client to losses on money they want to safely grow; a retirement fund for example. Going down this path, there is a metric called "catastrophic losses" which measures a firms exposure to losing 70% of their market value and never being able to fully recover. Within the Robo-advisor domain, there is another key metric that is used to compare their individual success. This is called the roll-over rate. Robo-advisor companies are still relatively new. Like any "new" business there is a transition between early adopters and this domain becoming the standard of how people invest their hard-earned paychecks. The roll-over rate is essentially a retention metric used to measure how many people stay with their robo-advisor and in what amount of their total portfolio do they invest with their particular robo-advisor firm.

* While researching into Betterment, as well as diving into their competition, Betterment is consistently in the running for "best" robo-advisor. They were one of the very first robo-advisor firms to enter the marketplace, giving them the first-movers advantage. Also, their very low-cost structure makes them extremely competitive. With their unique approach to goal-based portfolios and low-cost structures, they have a robust offering that others in the domain are working diligently on trying to replicate. Also, they help clients identify tax features of each of their investment types so you can easily decide which is best for them. You can also opt-in to receiving dividends and automatically rolling them back into your investment instead of cashing out to you Betterment checking/savings account. It doesn't get any easier than Betterment!

## Recommendations

* Currently, Betterment only offers investing into portfolios, but not the granularity of investing into individual stocks and cryptocurrencies. One of Betterments competitors, M1 Finance, does offer this. This seems like the next logical step in Betterment's offering. As a client, I can go the "easy" route and put my money into broad index-tracking equity funds. However, if Betterment were to adopt this new offering, a client who read about a new company or perhaps an existing company that is releasing a new product, or a cryptocurrency they thought was going to increase in value, they could choose to invest a small portion into this specific company and perhaps get a larger return than the index. Otherwise, it seems as though as investors are becoming more educated they might want more control over the way their investment is distributed and therefore change platforms, or at least move a portion of their total investment onto another platform such as M1 or Robinhood.

* This additional offering would help retain customers as they become more knowledgeable about investing in general, or they are excited about a new product offering from a company and think they have found a "winner" in the market. It also makes Betterment more competitive against companies like Robinhood since they would not only be able to purchase specific shares, but also have the lions share of their investment into goal-oriented portfolios as that is their core-business. This would make Betterment more of "one-stop-shop" for a clients investments, from beginner all the way to retirement, from novice to expert.

* Since Betterment rebalances on a monthly basis, they would need to implement technologies that would allow for higher volume of trade throughout the day, week, and month. Also, they would need to implement a crypto-wallet if they were to offer the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrencies which would include blockchain technology.

* The difference between Robo-advisor index-tracking equity funds and being able to select specific stocks/cryptocurrencies is that clients would be more active on the side of buying and selling specific stocks and cryptos. Traditionally, customers of Betterment deposit money in a lump sum, and then add to it from time-to-time. However, people who use Robinhood for example, are typically putting money in more frequently, as well as cashing out more frequently. They might buy and sell the same stock in the same day, or multiple times throughout the day. The infrastructure in place for Betterment would certainly not be able to handle that type of volume and frequency. If they were to have a crash or their system went down due to too much stress via volume, their customers would quickly lose faith and move their portfolios to another platform.

# BETTERMENT - Wealth Management Reimagined

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company. Betterment uses robo-advising and automated cash management services to bring efficiency into the financial advisory industry. They are registered with SEC as well as a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority(FIRA). Betterment is a registered investment advisor and broker-dealer, however their strategy is very tech-oriented compared to traditional financial/investment advisory companies. While Betterment offers checking and savings accounts, traditional and Roth IRAs, as well as human financial advisors, their main focus and point of differentiation is in automated goal-based investing. To achieve this, they manage portfolios of passive index-tracking equity and fixed income ETFs.

* When was the company incorporated? Betterment was founded in 2008 and officially launched in June of 2010 at *TechCrunch Disrupt New York*, an annual 3-day event that includes meet-and-greets with investors, special guest lectures, and even hackathons, winning the award of "Biggest New York Disruptor." 

* Who are the founders of the company? Jon Stein and Eli Broverman are the founders of Betterment. Jon Stein initially began the project with his roommate, a Google software engineer, and Eli Broverman was brought in to handle the regulations associated with starting a financial company since he was a securities lawyer at the time. Interestingly enough, Jon and Eli met over regular poker games.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? The idea for Betterment came about in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. There was widespread greed in not only the mortgage industry, but also in the credit rating companies and derivitatives markets that led to a massive amount of wealth being obliterated, leaving many unable to make payments on their mortgages and losing large portions of their retirement funds. Jon Stein wanted to built a company, "to help people do what's right with their money so they can live better." Betterment claims to act as a fiduciary and that they behave with their clients best interest in mind.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? In December of 2010, Betterment raised $3M in their Series A round. There were 8 total investors, the lead investor being Bessemer Venture Partners. Series B was announced in October of 2012, raising $10M. From there, the funding amounts saw a sizeable increase as follows: Series C $32M, Series D $60M, Series E $100M, and Series E $70. This brings the total funding amount to $275M, the lastest round in August of 2017.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? Betterment was built with the client's best interest interest in mind, in regards to those clients reaching their financial goals and doing so in a responsible manner. Greed was running rampant in financial markets and corruption and deception finally came to a head when the mortgage industry collapsed. By managing risk with clients' goals in mind, the product offered is a customer-tailered portfolio of passive index-tracking equity and fixed-income ETFs.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) Betterment was built for a wide range of customers; from older generations looking to safely maintain their wealth through retirement and golden-years to young investors who are quite busy with the opening chapters of their careers who want a one-stop-shop investment management company that automates a lot of the heavy lifting(research and trading). Each year, more money is transferred from traditional avenues into robo-advisor led investment platforms. Robo-advised assets under management are projected to hit over $1.3 trillion by the end of 2021, and over $2.8 trillion by 2025 showing annual growth rate of over 20%. In a little over 10 short years, Betterment has accumulated over $29 billion of assets under management. The traditional competitors in the space are investment and brokerage firms. Examples of these traditional competitors include Charles Schwab and Edward Jones, as well as investment managers within retail banks and putting together your own portfolio through platforms such as E-Trade, or even newer platforms such as Robinhood. What sets Betterment apart from the others is the level of automation they have implemented into the portfolio managing process. Based on information the client provides, such as their goals and timelines, Betterment can put together an investment strategy tailered to the client without needing employees such as traditional brokers. This ultimately creates a cost-saving to the client in lower management fees, increasing the potential return for their clients.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing - you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) Betterment from its origin has implemented robo-advisors that take information provided by the client and can offer portfolio strategies that are specific to the client. They have implemented their technology into the financial industry through javaScript, Python, and PHP coding, delivering this content at high data transfer speeds with Amazon CloudFront, and using Google Cloud Platform's suite of cloud computing services. Betterment uses Google Analytics for interpreting information and fine-tune their offerings, and then uses Mixpanel to convert, engag, and retain more users. Their DevOps uses Docker containers to simulate multiple physical worker machines that connect to the officially maintained containers. Betterment also uses business tools such as WordPress to generate aesthetically pleasing materials aesthetically to clients and Qualaroo to deploy surveys to continuously improve upon their products and services.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? Betterment, like most of the FinTech companies that my classmates are covering for this first homework assignment, spills into several different domains of the financial industry. Investment management and Robo-advising are the areas of focus, but since they offer checking and savings accounts, as well as Roth IRAs, they are very much in the personal finance and online banking domains as well.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? Trends of FinTech companies in the Investment management domain have been implementing an increasing amount of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, and more recently blockchain. These tools allow new players in the space, as well as adaptive veteran companies to differentiate their offerings as well as better utilize the massive amount of data they collect to make more informed decisions. Other trends include using the Internet of Things (IoT) to pass information about about products and services to their customer base as well as get real-time data about their clients' assets. Regulation is becoming increasingly complex and FinTech companies have utilized RegTech to remain compliant. Since the 2008 financial crisis, financial regulations have become much tighter, and this trend of streamlining the compliance aspect of their businesses is a natural next step in dealing with an increasing amount of "red-tape." There are many other trends that have occured in the last 10 years, but one of the most important of those trends is how FinTech companies have prioritized the privacy of the data they collect. There have been massive hacks, such as Equifax breach, leading to trends of increased data security. Cybercrime has grown into a massive problem globally and this trend will surely continue to ensure a safe-environment for the data of FinTech customers' data.

* What are the other major companies in this domain? The number of Robo-advising investment platforms is growing very rapidly. Some of the other players in the space include SoFi, Wealthfront, Vanguard, and STASH. There are slight differences in these competitors, mainly in management fees, account minimums, as well as different promotions such as $5,000 amount of assets managed for free or your first 90 days having no advisory fees. However, there are also quite a bit of similarities in their approach. All firms seek to diversify their client's portfolios based on their goals and appetite for risk. With these preferences in mind, as well as timeframes for these goals, Robo-advisor investment firms are able to diversify investments into index funds, specific companies, fixed-income ETFs, and bonds.

# BETTERMENT - Wealth Management Reimagined

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company. Betterment uses robo-advising and automated cash management services to bring efficiency into the financial advisory industry. They are registered with SEC as well as a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority(FIRA). Betterment is a registered investment advisor and broker-dealer, however their strategy is very tech-oriented compared to traditional financial/investment advisory companies. While Betterment offers checking and savings accounts, traditional and Roth IRAs, as well as human financial advisors, their main focus and point of differentiation is in automated goal-based investing. To achieve this, they manage portfolios of passive index-tracking equity and fixed income ETFs.

* When was the company incorporated? Betterment was founded in 2008 and officially launched in June of 2010 at *TechCrunch Disrupt New York*, an annual 3-day event that includes meet-and-greets with investors, special guest lectures, and even hackathons, winning the award of "Biggest New York Disruptor." 

* Who are the founders of the company? Jon Stein and Eli Broverman are the founders of Betterment. Jon Stein initially began the project with his roommate, a Google software engineer, and Eli Broverman was brought in to handle the regulations associated with starting a financial company since he was a securities lawyer at the time. Interestingly enough, Jon and Eli met over regular poker games.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? The idea for Betterment came about in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. There was widespread greed in not only the mortgage industry, but also in the credit rating companies and derivitatives markets that led to a massive amount of wealth being obliterated, leaving many unable to make payments on their mortgages and losing large portions of their retirement funds. Jon Stein wanted to built a company, "to help people do what's right with their money so they can live better." Betterment claims to act as a fiduciary and that they behave with their clients best interest in mind.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? In December of 2010, Betterment raised $3M in their Series A round. There were 8 total investors, the lead investor being Bessemer Venture Partners. Series B was announced in October of 2012, raising $10M. From there, the funding amounts saw a sizeable increase as follows: Series C $32M, Series D $60M, Series E $100M, and Series E $70. This brings the total funding amount to $275M, the lastest round in August of 2017.
